      <p>My summer internship got cancelled last minute due to the pandemic </p>
      <p>I decided to make the most of an unfortunate situation</p>
      <h1>The purpose of this Website</h1>
      <p>
        is to provide a summary of the projects I worked on in the summer of
        2020, while getting a chance to quickly play around with JS, React and
        CSS - as my degree mainly involves programming in languages like C, C++,
        Python and Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is something I quickly hacked together and should not be regarded
        as a finished product. I have deliberately kept it as simple as possible
        as the goal was to create a functional website in a very short amount of
        time. As such I have commited the cardinal sin of neither writing any
        tests nor ensuring compatibility with every browser on the market.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each project will have its' own section, featuring a unique design. I
        wanted to take the chance to play around with various design ideas.
