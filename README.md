# Github pages
You do not have to download the project and run it locally in order to see it. To save you the hassle of setup I have hosted the project on **[Github Pages](https://adamgaidi.github.io/summer-projects/)**.

# Errors
I have discovered that Safari does not display one of the headers correctly. For the best experience I advice using Chrome (or maybe Firefox) as Chrome is the browser used during development.
